We are pleased to pioneer this strategic intervention for the continent; it is a key part of our vision to give African businesses a plug-and-play infrastructure to operate reliably across borders.\" He added.",

Passpoint has unlocked Ivory Coast: Momo (MTN, Moov, Orange, Wave); Senegal: Momo (Orange, Free, Wave Espresso); Benin: Momo (Moov, MTN, Carte); Burkina Faso: Momo (Orange, Moov, Coris); Togo: Momo (TMoney, Moov) and Mali: Momo (Orange, Moov, Sama).",

The newly activated corridors span the heart of Francophone Africa, creating global opportunities for the region's currency, the West African CFA franc (XOF). These corridors also address key challenges businesses face, from fragmented mobile money networks to reconciliation delays and regional compliance and replace them with one simplified, scalable system."
